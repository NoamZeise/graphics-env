* Import and Draw fonts
* 3D Skeletal Animation
* Optional Resource Pools - keep some assets loaded, load and unload other assets
Non-Graphics Features
* Simple keyboard/mouse/controller input 
* First and Third person cameras
* audio playback

* external OPTIONAL:   [libsndfile](https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile) handles audio file loading
* external OPTIONAL:   [portaudio](http://www.portaudio.com/) handles cross platform audio playback

# setup

Cmake is required for building on all platforms.

### linux with apt on debian based systems
vulkan tools
```
$ sudo apt-get install vulkan-tools
```
vulkan loader / validation layers / spriv compilers
```
$ sudo apt-get install libvulkan-dev vulkan-validationlayers-dev spirv-tools
```
test vulkan works
```
$ vkcube
```
additional libraries
```
$ sudo apt-get install libfreetype-dev libsndfile1-dev libasound-dev portaudio19-dev
```

### windows

* download [libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/#Download) compile and put in your lib and include directories, and distrubute dll with your binaries

* download [portaudio](http://files.portaudio.com/docs/v19-doxydocs/compile_windows.html) compile and put in your lib and include directories, and distrubute dll with your binaries

You may need to specify `sndfile_DIR` and `portaudio_DIR` with the cmake folders of those libraries ( ie where the `portaudioConfig.cmake` files are).

Download the [Vulkan SDK](https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/), for getting the vulkan validation layers and the tools for compiling shaders into spirv.

# Build with example using CMake

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/NoamZeise/graphics-env.git
cd graphics-env
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
Then example binaries should be in `examples/` within the build folder . Note that _PortAudio_ and _Libsndfile_ dlls wont be built with this, so on windows you'll need to copy the dlls for those into the same path as the example binaries.


# Customizing the build

## Cmake Flags

* NO\_AUDIO -> don't use sndfile or portaudio. Audio functions will not work.
* NO\_FREETYPE -> don't use Freetype. Font file loading will not work.
* NO\_ASSIMP -> don't use Assimp. Loading 3D model files won't work. 
* NO\_VULKAN -> don't use Vulkan backend.
* NO\_OPENGL -> don't use OpenGL backend
* GRAPHICS\_STATIC -> build libraries statically

## Enabling other 3D model formats

To use formats other than those enabled by default, you must set `ASSIMP_BUILD_XYZ_IMPORTER` 
to true, where `XYZ` is your format, before loading the cmake files for this project.

For example to enable the blend format, you would have `set(ASSIMP_BUILD_BLEND_IMPORTER TRUE)`
somewhere in your cmake file before calling `add_subdirectory(graphics-env)`. 
Check the [assimp](https://assimp.org/) docs for more info 
on supported formats.

You should then be able to load these newly enabled formats the same as you load the default ones.

# Common Build Errors

##### Missing <vulkan/...> error
pass `-D VULKAN_HEADERS_INSTALL_DIR=/your/path/to/your/installed/vulkan/headers`
to cmake when generating this project

##### Missing sndfile or portaudio dirs
try building anyways, as they may be picked up at buildtime (especially with mingw or linux). 
If there are still issues (usually for windows with MSVC compiler),
assuming you have downloaded release builds of `sndfile` and `portaudio`,
you can pass to cmake these options.
- `-D sndfile_DIR=sndfile-build-folder/cmake`
- `-D portaudio_DIR=portaudio-build-folder/cmake/portaudio`

If you don't need audio or want to use your own audio lib you can pass
`-D NO_AUDIO=true` to disable these dependancies.

# Notes

### Proper export settings for 3D modelling software

When exporting your models, ensure you are using relative paths to textures.
Also ensure that models are exported with the Z Up direction option.

# Todo list:
bugs:
* instability reported on some AMD GPUs (unable to test this directly)

features:
* user created fonts
* define new shader pipelines outside of render
* better model material support (right now just diffuse colour)
